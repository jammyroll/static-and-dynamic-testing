### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
    #   it should be a double equals sign not a single and missing a colon after the else
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
    # dif should be def and missing a comma between the cards, also not indented correctly and it should return card1 not card


def cards_total(self, cards):
  total 
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
  #total should = 0 in line 36. return is indented wrong,return should be outside the for loop. the whole function is indented wrong making it sit outside the class
```
